# Task 1 – Titanic Dataset EDA

Performed basic exploratory data analysis on a Titanic-like dataset.

## Steps
- Loaded the dataset with pandas.
- Cleaned data: fixed column names, filled missing values, dropped zero-only columns.
- Visualized data: bar chart (Survived), histogram (Age), correlation heatmap.

## Key Insights
- Most passengers were 20–40 years old.
- Majority did not survive.
- Higher fares linked to higher survival chances.
- Most travelled in 3rd class.

**Outcome:** Jupyter Notebook with EDA, visualizations, and summary of findings.
